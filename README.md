Set user defined notifications using Alarm Manager

Notifications provide short, timely information about events in your app while it's not in use. This page teaches you how to create a notification with various features for Android 4.0 (API level 14) and higher. For an introduction to how notifications appear on Android, see the Notifications Overview. For sample code that uses notifications, see the Android Notifications Sample.

Notice that the code on this page uses the NotificationCompat APIs from the Android support library. These APIs allow you to add features available only on newer versions of Android while still providing compatibility back to Android 4.0 (API level 14). However, some new features such as the inline reply action result in a no-op on older versions.
